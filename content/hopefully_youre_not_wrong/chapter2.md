*Three Days Later*

Marinette was deeply absorbed in a sketch she was working on when she heard a tap on the glass door to her balcony. She put her work down and climbed the ladder to her loft bed. To her surprise, she saw Chat Noir peeking in the window and smiling at her. She grinned back and opened the door to let him in.

“I’d say look what the cat dragged in but you appear to have come alone!” she said with a mischievous grin. “So what brings you here on this feline evening?”

Chat Noir laughed quietly, “Hey, you’re stealing all my lines!” He protested, folding his arms and pretending to pout.

Marinette giggled. “I’m sorry, I suppose that’s true. But my question still stands. What can I do for you?”

I have a big favor to ask,” Chat replied. “I need somewhere safe and private to discuss something with Ladybug and I was wondering if we could borrow your space for a little while.”

Marinette bit back a laugh and put on her most serious expression. “Well of course I would be happy to help the heroes of Paris!” she exclaimed in the most earnest tone she could muster. “Do you have a date in mind?”

“Well,” Chat said thoughtfully. “Perhaps the day after tomorrow, Friday evening? I’ll need to confirm with Ladybug that she can make that. I can let you know tomorrow if that’s ok.”

“Sure!” Marinette replied. “I can make plans to go see a friend that night so the space will be all yours.”

“Aw, thanks Purrincess! You’re the best!” Chat exclaimed. “I’ll let you know if I can get everything arranged by tomorrow, ok?”

“No problem, Chat. I’ll talk to you tomorrow, same time?”

Chat nodded in agreement. “Until then!” he said. He opened the door to the balcony and climbed out before launching himself into the darkening sky. Marinette smiled watching him disappear.

“Friday, hmm?” she murmured to herself. “I better go in and wait for his call.”
