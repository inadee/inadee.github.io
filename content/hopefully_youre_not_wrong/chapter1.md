“I need to talk to you,” Chat Noir whispered to Ladybug as they both watched the Miraculous repair the last akuma’s damage.

“Ok…” Ladybug trailed off, waiting to hear what her partner had to say.

“Not here. I know neither of us has much time before we transform. I’m gonna recharge and then can we meet in five minutes on the Eiffel Tower in our usual spot?”

“Of course!” Ladybug replied, looking concerned. “Is everything o-okay?”

“Everything is fine,” he reassured her. Impulsively, he leaned over and kissed her cheek. To his surprise, she didn’t pull away. Instead, she closed her eyes for a moment and leaned against him. “See you in five minutes,” he whispered, putting his arm around her shoulder and giving her a quick squeeze. She opened her eyes, nodded and smiled.

“Exactly what are you planning to talk to Ladybug about?” asked Plagg suspiciously.

“Well…” Adrien trailed off nervously.

Plagg remained silent but raised his tiny eyebrows slowly. Adrien handed him some Camembert but said nothing more, trying to read the expression in Plagg’s bright green eyes. He might be mistaken, but he felt like he was detecting a tiny sparkle of mischief in his Kwami’s eyes, despite his best attempts to remain stern.

Adrien remained silent a few moments more, staring at Plagg in an effort to break his composure.

I’m having a staring contest with an ancient being that holds the power of destruction, he thought to himself.

Sighing, Adrien looked down and relented. “For the past year, since Ladybug became the Guardian, I’ve done my best to back off with the flirting. You know I’ve been doing my best to be a better partner to her and support her in the way she really needs instead of staying focused on expressing my feelings for her. I realized that I was only adding more pressure and I couldn’t do that to her anymore. I might have been expressing love as I felt it, but it wasn’t love in the way she needed it. Now I feel our partnership is growing stronger but there is so much unsaid. I’ve been letting my actions in battle and on patrol do the talking. I feel like now she might be ready to talk to me about what the last year has been like for her and I- I really want to know.“

Plagg’s expression relaxed. “Well kid, it’s good to know you have your head on straight finally. Try not to lay it on too thick and you might even get somewhere.”

“Get somewhere? What do you mean?” Adrien again had the sneaking feeling that Plagg was holding out on him.

“Never mind, kid. You better hurry up. We’re due at the tower now.”

“Plagg, claws out!”

Ladybug landed gracefully in their favorite secluded spot on the tower. Chat Noir was nowhere to be seen so she sat down to wait for him, swinging her legs over the ledge. As Marinette, she couldn’t imagine sitting in such a precarious spot but for reasons she couldn’t explain, the normally vertigo inducing views didn’t bother her in the slightest. It was an unusually warm fall day and she closed her eyes, enjoying the warm breeze and feeling the heat of the tower slowly decreasing as the sun set. She took a few deep breaths and then opened her eyes to look for Chat. She checked the time on her communicator and noted it had been six minutes since Chat had left her so they could each recharge.

“Sorry I’m late,” Chat apologized as he hopped up next to her and put his baton away. “Plagg was interrogating me.”

Ladybug laughed, “ Well at least it looks like curiosity didn’t kill the cat,” she said with a small twinkle in her eye.

Chat grinned, appreciating her joke and also the playful expression on her face. He’d experienced so few light moments with her since she unexpectedly had her training for the role of the Guardian disrupted to become the actual Guardian. All the fun and playful flirting and teasing had disappeared the moment Master Fu renounced his role and Ladybug’s demeanor had instantly become much more focused. There had been many moments since when the focus would crack slightly and he would see glimpses of the enormous pressure and danger she felt. Although he did not know who she was, he knew Ladybug was close to his own age and he couldn’t imagine what it would be like to protect the Miraculous on top of all the other secrets they both had to keep from their family and friends.

“So what did you want to talk about?” she asked, leaning into him slightly.

Chat smiled and put his arm around her shoulders, drawing her closer. He felt her stiffen in surprise and then relax a tiny bit. “Hey it’s ok, bug,” he reassured her. “You’re my partner and I want you to feel comfortable. If you want me to move my arm, I will.”

“No, that’s ok and please keep reminding me of that,” she murmured, relaxing fully against him. “I’m glad to have you as my partner.” She looked up at him for a moment. He had grown so much in the last year compared to her and her head fit perfectly against his chest. She could faintly feel his slightly accelerated heartbeat near her ear.

“I’ll be glad to,” Chat replied. “I know we see each other pretty often but I have missed you so much. I’ve wanted to talk to you and help you in any way I could but you’ve felt-- “ he paused, “a million miles away even as we’ve been fighting together.”

Ladybug smiled. Unbeknownst to him, she knew quite a bit of what he was feeling due to his regular visits with herself as Marinette. It was probably the only way she had been able to keep herself together at all. However, the tension of keeping yet another secret from him--listening to his thoughts felt like breaking a promise.He would never have confided his worries about Ladybug to Marinette if he had known who he was actually talking to.

“I am so sorry,” she said aloud, interrupting her own thoughts and bringing her focus back to Chat.

“It’s nothing to apologize about milady,” Chat replied smoothly. “You have had greater burdens than I can even imagine put on you in the heat of a terrible moment. I’ve just tried to be as supportive as I can. I apologize for how much pressure I was adding to the situation with my flirting and jokes. I-I realize that probably made it seem like I didn’t care about how you were feeling at the time.”

“Chat, no,” Ladybug said quietly, putting her hand on his knee. “I know you cared how I felt. It’s just everything has been falling apart so quickly both as Ladybug and in my civilian life. I had to make all these hard choices at my own expense and it was s-so hard not to be selfish. I reached a point where everything I w-wanted was going to hurt someone so I just shut it all off. I focused on being a better Ladybug and being a good friend without expecting anything from anyone. And now… the pain of all those sacrifices is slowly decreasing and I can just about bear it.” she looked up at Chat and smiled a very shaky smile.

“I can promise you that not one moment has gone by where I’ve seen you as anything less than the truly wonderful Ladybug that you are,” Chat said in a soft reassuring voice.

Ladybug took a deep breath and closed her eyes. She could feel the altogether too familiar feeling of tears burning behind her eyelids. A single tear escaped and coursed through her eyelashes and down her cheek. She took a deep breath, attempting to calm herself.

Chat looked at her with concern. “Ladybug?” he asked quietly. “Are you okay?”

“Y-y-yeah,” she took another big breath and shakily let it out. Slowly, she opened her eyes and gazed at her Kitty’s bright green ones. He smiled, locking his gaze onto her watery blue eyes. After a moment she smiled too and they both turned to look out over the city of Paris.

They sat together in comfortable silence, gazing at the deepening colors of the sunset. Each of them was trying to read what their partner was feeling and trying to figure out what to say next.

As Ladybug looked up at Chat Noir, she could feel so much turmoil bubbling up inside of her. She wondered if he was feeling it too. As far as she could tell, he looked calm and attentive. Usually he was bubbly, talkative one and his silence actually compelled her to say more than she intended.

“I- I really wish I could talk to you all the time!” she burst out. “It feels so unfair that we can communicate so clearly and say what we feel and we don’t even know each other!”

“We do know each other,” he reassured her. “Although I know what you mean. The longer I spend with this alternate identity, the harder it is to be completely honest about anything in my civilian life. Everything gets more and more tangled together and I feel like I am struggling to keep my stories straight.”

“I feel exactly the same way,” she agreed. “It feels so wrong to protect the lies I tell but I cannot think of any other way to keep myself and everyone else safe. With Master Fu gone, there is no longer an adult that I can go to and ask advice. No one knows me on both sides of the mask-apart from Tikki I guess.”

“Yeah and that’s just not the same is it?” Chat said, reflectively. “Plagg has definitely kept me from feeling entirely alone but I still feel so isolated. I know I’ve said this before but isolation is a pretty big feature of my civilian life. I try to connect with friends now that my father lets me go out a little more but it’s difficult lying to them about a huge part of my identity. It shapes every decision I make and every conflict I encounter. Whether I mean to or not, I inevitably push everyone away. I even tried seeing someone and it just fell apart so fast. Now I am just trying to rescue the friendship we had before but she can tell I’m not always being truthful with her and she doesn’t know why… she can’t… I just wonder-” Chat paused, wondering if he was willing to reveal his deepest anxiety to his partner. She already had so much to deal with and he didn’t want her to interpret this as more pressure on her.

“What is it, Kitty?” she asked when he didn’t continue. Gently, she squeezed his knee and smiled at him.

Chat smiled at his favorite endearment from her. Ladybug had been careful in the way she touched him in the last year and the physical contact and pet name felt deeply reassuring. “I just wonder if this means I will have to remain mostly--alone-- until we defeat Hawkmoth.”

“Oh, Kitty…” Ladybug took a deep breath. “I know what you mean. I started having more friendships when my role as Ladybug started but now… I feel like I am losing everyone. I even felt like I was starting to lose you and yet I kept pushing you away even as it was hurting so much. I-I tried seeing someone too and I just couldn’t feel the connection he seemed to feel with me. I was constantly hiding things and making excuses and he was so understanding--it was actually kind of infuriating.” she admitted.

“Infuriating? That’s a pretty strong word Milady!” Chat raises his eyebrows mischievously. If he was completely honest with himself, this revelation from Ladybug was causing a small twinge of triumph to ping in his heart. He restrained the impulse to pull her even closer but he couldn’t resist putting his free hand on top of Ladybug’s where it rested on his leg.

Ladybug startled slightly at his touch, then giggled and relaxed again. “Yeah, well I know the poor guy meant well but that dynamic just doesn’t work for me I guess.”

They both sat quietly for a few moments. Chat had fought the impulse to say something flirty after her last statement. He knew that saying the wrong thing at this point risked ending the most comforting conversation he had enjoyed with anyone in a very long time.

At that moment, inexplicably, he thought of Marinette and how much time they had spent comforting each other. Those moments had felt so similar to this and yet it felt like each of them was hiding something from the other. He knew, of course exactly what he was hiding from Marinette but he couldn’t guess what she could be hiding from him. Blinking for a moment to consciously detach himself from that memory, he returned his focus to Ladybug. He squeezed her hand gently and nuzzled the side of her head. She nuzzled back which made him start in surprise and look down at her beautiful, masked face.

Ladybug looked up at Chat and grinned. She wasn’t sure why she had returned his affectionate nuzzle but she didn’t have the usual sense of regret that she felt when she instinctively reached out to him. Right now, they felt so connected and it was the happiest and most content she had felt in months. She realized at that moment just how much she had retreated from everyone but especially from her closest, dearest friend. She knew she shouldn’t be too hard on herself. She had been completely overwhelmed by all the upheaval and heartbreak. It was a wonder she could even put up any kind of front to everyone when she had felt so much raw pain inside. It was a welcome relief to feel the first twinges of ‘normality’ entering back into her life.

“This feels so good,” she said aloud. “Talking to you, hearing how you feel.. It’s a relief. I’m sorry I waited so long to let you in and I am so thankful that you…” she trailed off, trying to find the right words.
“I’m so happy you agreed to spend time with me,” he said with such sincerity in his voice, it took her breath away.

Suddenly the bubbling turmoil was back, the words rising that she had pushed back again and again. This time she wouldn’t… couldn’t stop them.

“I don’t want to wait anymore!” she blurted out. “I...I want you to know… who I am and I want…”she broke off, her hand suddenly squeezing his leg. She felt Chat’s own hand closing over hers, his claws carefully curling around her fingers so he didn’t scratch her. They looked at each other with such intensity that neither could speak for a moment.

Ladybug took a deep breath and finished her sentence. “I want to know who you are too, Chat. So I guess what I am asking…” she broke off again and then whispered, “Do you want… to know too?”

Chat Noir was in complete shock at his Lady’s words. He had been dreaming of this moment for years. After all the heartbreak of Ladybug’s sudden, shocking transition to her role as the Guardian, his wish to truly know her had seemed farther away than ever. He took a deep breath, feeling the tears stinging in the corners of his eyes. “Are you sure milady?”

“It’s all I can think about,” she confessed. “To be honest, part of why I’ve kept my distance was so I could keep denying this feeling when I’m with you. But… I am so afraid. I know how dangerous it could be… I once had a visit from a future miraculous holder because you had learned my identity and then somehow, you were akumatized. The miraculous holder took me into this terrible future event and there you were… fighting the butterfly and its hold on you was torturing you. Everything was destroyed and you were all alone. We fought and there were moments where you were helping me and moments when you were succumbing to the impulses of the akuma and trying to fight me. I finally captured the butterfly and purified it and then the miraculous holder said I had fixed it and brought me back to the moment where it apparently all started. I still don’t have any idea what happened that led to Hawkmoth akumatizing you…” she took a huge breath and looked up at Chat. She could see how shocked he was by her revelations. “But I also think that if we retreat from each other now, our partnership will weaken and eventually fail. We have always been so in sync and I feel our journey together has brought us to this point. In order for us to keep building this trust in each other and our partnership, we have to do this. And I have faith that we will both be so careful with our knowledge and we will avoid the path I witnessed before.”

Chat couldn’t help but grin. “That’s the most Ladybug speech you’ve made in a long time,” he laughed.

Ladybug blushed and started to withdraw her hand from Chat’s. “I’m sorry. I guess I got carried away,” she said self-consciously.

Chat tightened his hold on her hand. “N-no don’t take that the wrong way! I love your fiery speeches!” he exclaimed. And I love you even more. He thought to himself. “And you know I couldn’t agree with you more,” he continued instead. “Sooo how do you want to do this?”
